**Sources:** Moody’s rating announcements and historical data ([Mauritius Sovereign credit ratings - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Mauritius/credit_rating/#:~:text=Moody%27s%20Baa2%20Positive%20watch%203%2F2012,11%2F2003%20Moody%27s%20Baa2%20Stable%203%2F1996)) ([Mauritius Sovereign credit ratings - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Mauritius/credit_rating/#:~:text=Agency%20Rating%20Outlook%20Date%20Moody%27s,4%2F2020%20Moody%27s%20Baa1%20Stable%203%2F2018)). All ratings are for Mauritius’ long-term foreign currency sovereign credit. “Negative/Positive Watch” indicates a review for downgrade or upgrade. Mauritius has consistently maintained an *investment grade* rating (Baa3 or higher) throughout this period.

## Summary of Key Rating Trends

- **Consistent Investment Grade:** Mauritius has maintained an investment-grade credit rating from Moody’s since the initial rating in 1996. It started at **Baa2** and *never fell below Baa3*, making it one of only two African countries with an investment-grade sovereign rating in recent years ([Public Notice: Mauritius preserves its Investment Grade status further to the latest Moody’s rating | Bank of Mauritius](https://www.bom.mu/media/media-releases/public-notice-mauritius-preserves-its-investment-grade-status-further-latest-moodys-rating#:~:text=Baa2%20Negative%20to%20Baa3%20Stable)).

- **Long Period of Stability:** From the late 1990s through the 2000s, Moody’s kept Mauritius at Baa2 with a stable outlook for many years. There were occasional outlook changes (e.g. negative outlook/watch in 2005–2007) but no change in the letter rating during that decade ([Mauritius Sovereign credit ratings - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Mauritius/credit_rating/#:~:text=Moody%27s%20Baa2%20Positive%20watch%203%2F2012,11%2F2003%20Moody%27s%20Baa2%20Stable%203%2F1996)).

- **Upgrade in 2012:** Moody’s upgraded Mauritius to **Baa1** in 2012 – the first and only notch upgrade in the period – reflecting improved economic resilience and fiscal management ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=managed%20to%20accumulate%20additional%20international,country%E2%80%99s%20credit%20rating%20to%20Baa1)). The Baa1 rating (with stable outlook) was then maintained through the 2010s amid steady growth and prudent policies.

- **Downgrades after 2020:** The global COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point. In April 2020 the outlook was shifted to negative, and **Moody’s downgraded Mauritius** in 2021 (to Baa2) and again in 2022 (to **Baa3**) as the economic and fiscal impact of the pandemic materialized ([Mauritius Sovereign credit ratings - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Mauritius/credit_rating/#:~:text=Standard%20%26%20Poor%27s%20BBB,Moody%27s%20Baa2%20Positive%20watch%203%2F2012)). These downgrades moved Mauritius to the lowest rung of investment grade by 2022.

- **Recent Outlook Changes:** As of 2024, the sovereign rating stands at **Baa3**. Moody’s initially assigned a stable outlook after the 2022 downgrade, but by January 2025 the outlook was revised to **negative** again, signaling lingering concerns ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=Friday%2031%20January%202025%3A%20The,revised%20from%20%E2%80%98stable%E2%80%99%20to%20%E2%80%98negative%E2%80%99)). This suggests Moody’s caution about Mauritius’s near-term credit trajectory while the rating remains at investment grade.

## Analysis of Factors Influencing Mauritius’ Ratings

Moody’s rating decisions for Mauritius have been influenced by a balance of **economic performance**, **fiscal/debt dynamics**, **government policy**, **institutional strength**, and **external conditions**. Over the past 28 years, Mauritius’ creditworthiness has evolved in response to both internal developments and external shocks:

- **Economic Structure and Performance:** Mauritius’ economy has transformed from a mono-crop (sugar) base into a more diversified, service-oriented economy.
  Through the late 1990s and 2000s, relatively **high income levels and growth** supported the Baa2 rating. However, the mid-2000s brought challenges as Mauritius lost preferential trade agreements in textiles and sugar, causing a “permanent deterioration” in terms of trade ([Mauritius: 2007 Article IV Consultation:  Staff Report; Staff Statement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; Statement by the Staff Representatives; and Statement by the Executive Director for Mauritius](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Mauritius-2007-Article-IV-Consultation-Staff-Report-Staff-Statement-Public-Information-21037#:~:text=Summary)). Moody’s responded cautiously – evidenced by the negative outlook/watch around 2005–2007 – reflecting uncertainty about how the economy would adjust. The government’s broad-based economic reforms during that period (liberalizing trade, promoting new industries, fiscal consolidation) helped Mauritius return to a stable outlook by 2007–2008 as the economy began to find new drivers of growth ([Mauritius: 2007 Article IV Consultation:  Staff Report; Staff Statement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; Statement by the Staff Representatives; and Statement by the Executive Director for Mauritius](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Mauritius-2007-Article-IV-Consultation-Staff-Report-Staff-Statement-Public-Information-21037#:~:text=Summary)). Key sectors like tourism, financial services, and ICT grew in importance, bolstering economic resilience. By 2018, Moody’s noted Mauritius’ *“strong growth perspective and macroeconomic resilience to external shocks,”* with robust performance in tourism, finance, and ICT supporting the Baa1 rating ([Latest News | Intercontinental Trust](https://intercontinentaltrust.com/latest-news/moodys-maintains-mauritius-baa1-credit-rating#:~:text=Moody%E2%80%99s%20published%20its%20annual%20Credit,Mauritius%E2%80%99%20economic%20outlook%20as%20%E2%80%98stable%E2%80%99)).

- **Fiscal Health and Public Debt:** Fiscal policy and debt levels have been critical to Moody’s assessments. In the mid-2000s, rising budget deficits and debt created concern about the **“challenging fiscal situation”** and the government’s ability to rein it in (hence the negative outlook in 2005) ([Rating Action - Moody's Ratings](https://ratings.moodys.com/ratings-news/436493#:~:text=Rating%20Action%20,fiscal%20situation%2C%20considering%20the)). Successful fiscal reforms followed – including a Fiscal Responsibility law and expenditure restraint – which improved Mauritius’ debt trajectory going into the 2010s. By the time of the 2012 upgrade, public debt was on a sustainable path, and Moody’s upgrade to Baa1 was underpinned by expectations that debt metrics would continue improving ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=managed%20to%20accumulate%20additional%20international,country%E2%80%99s%20credit%20rating%20to%20Baa1)). Indeed, prior to the pandemic, debt was moderate and projected to decline to around 55–60% of GDP ([Latest News | Intercontinental Trust](https://intercontinentaltrust.com/latest-news/moodys-maintains-mauritius-baa1-credit-rating#:~:text=Communication%20Technology%20,to%20maintain%20a%20strong%20performance)), a positive factor for the rating. However, the **COVID-19 shock in 2020 led to a sharp deterioration** in public finances. The government ran a very large deficit (nearly 19% of GDP in 2021) to cushion the economy ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L227%20Gen,%282021%29%20Economic%20resiliency%3A%20baa2)), and **public debt jumped from ~57% of GDP pre-pandemic to over 80%** by 2021. Moody’s viewed this surge in debt and slow fiscal repair as a major credit weakness. The **downgrades in 2021 and 2022** were largely driven by concerns that Mauritius’s **debt burden and fiscal deficits** had materially worsened and would take time to reverse ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=MAKING%20WEAKENS%20MAURITIUS%27S%20CAPACITY%20TO,be%20slower%20than%20previously%20expected)) ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=stabilization%2C%20the%20government%20will%20likely,declining%20as%20the%20government%20forecasts)). Moreover, Moody’s cited **one-off measures** and unconventional policies (such as central bank-funded support via the Mauritius Investment Corporation) that masked the true fiscal position and undermined fiscal transparency ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=over%20the%20past%20two%20years,trajectory%20of%20government%20debt%20and)) ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20debt%20burden%20,require%20some%20additional%20measures%20%E2%80%93)). This signaled a weakening in institutional fiscal discipline, further pressuring the rating. By 2022, Moody’s expressed doubt that debt would quickly return to pre-pandemic levels, although it acknowledged government plans to reduce debt back to 60% of GDP in the medium term ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=MAKING%20WEAKENS%20MAURITIUS%27S%20CAPACITY%20TO,be%20slower%20than%20previously%20expected)).

- **Government Policies and Institutional Strength:** Throughout the years, Mauritius’ governance and policy framework have been important credit considerations. On the positive side, the country has a long record of **political stability, democratic governance, and prudent policymaking**, which has underpinned investor confidence. Moody’s has highlighted Mauritius’s *“stable political and macroeconomic environment”* as a key strength supporting its credit profile ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=RATIONALE%20FOR%20CHANGING%20THE%20OUTLOOK,Prior%20to%20the%20coronavirus)). The government’s responsiveness to challenges – for example, implementing **ambitious reforms in the mid-2000s** to diversify the economy and **prompt stimulus measures during the 2008–09 global financial crisis** – demonstrated policy credibility. The IMF noted that Mauritius entered the 2008 crisis with fiscal buffers (savings of 3% of GDP set aside) and deployed a targeted stimulus (~5% of GDP) to soften the downturn ([Microsoft Word - Document2](https://www.bom.mu/sites/default/files/pdf/Communique/IMF_PIN_Mauritius.pdf#:~:text=The%20authorities%E2%80%99%20policy%20response%20was,temporary%20package%20is%20intended%20to)) ([Microsoft Word - Document2](https://www.bom.mu/sites/default/files/pdf/Communique/IMF_PIN_Mauritius.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20post,looking%20debt)). Such actions likely helped Mauritius avoid any rating downgrade during that global crisis. In the 2010s, **sound monetary and financial sector management** (independent central bank, well-capitalized banks) and improvements in the business climate supported the country’s **“economic strength”** score in Moody’s rating methodology ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20important%20fiscal,one%20notch%20above%20country%20rating)). However, some **policy choices during the pandemic raised concerns** for Moody’s. The extensive use of central bank resources to fund recovery (e.g. the Mauritius Investment Corporation, funded by the Bank of Mauritius) blurred the lines between fiscal and monetary policy. Moody’s viewed this as a weakening of institutional strength and policy effectiveness, noting it *“reduces Mauritius’s capacity to absorb future shocks”* ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=MAKING%20WEAKENS%20MAURITIUS%27S%20CAPACITY%20TO,be%20slower%20than%20previously%20expected)) ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=This%20informs%20Moody%27s%20view%20that,measures%20can%20reduce%20financing%20needs)). In short, while strong institutions and governance have historically been a credit strength for Mauritius, recent departures from orthodox policy (to deal with an unprecedented shock) introduced some doubts about policy predictability.

- **External Shocks and Global Conditions:** As a small island economy, Mauritius is highly exposed to external events, and these have often triggered rating outlook changes or actions. The **loss of EU sugar and textile trade preferences** around 2005 was a structural external shock that tested the economy’s adaptability – Moody’s held the rating but signaled caution until Mauritius managed a successful transition to new industries ([Mauritius: 2007 Article IV Consultation:  Staff Report; Staff Statement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; Statement by the Staff Representatives; and Statement by the Executive Director for Mauritius](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Mauritius-2007-Article-IV-Consultation-Staff-Report-Staff-Statement-Public-Information-21037#:~:text=Summary)). The **global financial crisis of 2008–2009** and the European debt crisis in the early 2010s posed risks given Mauritius’s reliance on European markets for tourism and exports. In those cases, the country’s resilience (supported by policy response and diversification) meant it withstood the shocks without a downgrade. In fact, by 2012, amid the global uncertainties, Mauritius’s ability to maintain growth and stability contributed to the upgrade ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=The%20Mauritian%20economy%20performed%20reasonably,remains%20relatively%20high%20at%2010)) ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=managed%20to%20accumulate%20additional%20international,country%E2%80%99s%20credit%20rating%20to%20Baa1)). The **COVID-19 pandemic in 2020** was by far the most severe shock in decades: international travel halted and Mauritius’s tourism sector (a pillar of the economy) virtually shut down. GDP **contracted by roughly 15% in 2020**, the worst economic downturn in Mauritius’s modern history ([[PDF] MAURITIUS - World Bank](https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/794311492188165385/mpo-mus.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20MAURITIUS%20,2020%2C%20poverty%20is%20estimated)). This external shock directly led Moody’s to cut the outlook to negative and eventually downgrade the sovereign rating, as the pandemic eroded key credit metrics. Additionally, the global inflation spike and Ukraine war in 2022 created headwinds (higher import prices, inflation near 10% ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L165%20account%20for,year%20in))) that kept economic recovery and fiscal consolidation challenging. Despite these shocks, Mauritius’s accumulated strengths – such as its large foreign exchange reserves and stable financial system – provided buffers ([Public Notice: Mauritius preserves its Investment Grade status further to the latest Moody’s rating | Bank of Mauritius](https://www.bom.mu/media/media-releases/public-notice-mauritius-preserves-its-investment-grade-status-further-latest-moodys-rating#:~:text=The%20Bank%E2%80%99s%20policy%20measures%20are,significant%20buffer%20to%20external%20shocks)) ([Public Notice: Mauritius preserves its Investment Grade status further to the latest Moody’s rating | Bank of Mauritius](https://www.bom.mu/media/media-releases/public-notice-mauritius-preserves-its-investment-grade-status-further-latest-moodys-rating#:~:text=to%20absorb%20shocks%2C%20and%20fostering,significant%20buffer%20to%20external%20shocks)). Moody’s decision to assign a **stable outlook in 2022** (after the downgrade) reflected confidence that the economy would recover and **“the resilience of the Mauritian economy”** would help stabilize debt ([Public Notice: Mauritius preserves its Investment Grade status further to the latest Moody’s rating | Bank of Mauritius](https://www.bom.mu/media/media-releases/public-notice-mauritius-preserves-its-investment-grade-status-further-latest-moodys-rating#:~:text=two%20countries%20on%20the%20continent,with%20an%20Investment%20Grade%20rating)). By late 2024, tourism had rebounded strongly (growth of 8.9% in 2022 and around 7% in 2023) ([Mauritius Overview: Development news, research, data | World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mauritius/overview#:~:text=Bank%20www,GDP%20grew%20by%207)), helping the economy recover lost output. However, global economic uncertainties and the legacy of higher debt prompted Moody’s to once again revise the outlook to negative in early 2025 ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=Friday%2031%20January%202025%3A%20The,revised%20from%20%E2%80%98stable%E2%80%99%20to%20%E2%80%98negative%E2%80%99)).

- **Major Events and Rating Actions:** Specific events have corresponded with Moody’s rating actions. The **upgrade in June 2012 to Baa1** was driven by Mauritius’s demonstrated resilience after the 2008 crisis and progress in fiscal consolidation. The IMF at the time noted the country’s solid performance and neutral fiscal stance, as well as the successful economic adjustment that restored growth – factors that justified the improved rating ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=The%20Mauritian%20economy%20performed%20reasonably,remains%20relatively%20high%20at%2010)) ([Mauritius: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/pn1342#:~:text=managed%20to%20accumulate%20additional%20international,country%E2%80%99s%20credit%20rating%20to%20Baa1)). Conversely, the **2021 downgrade to Baa2** was triggered by the severe economic contraction and uncertain recovery path due to COVID-19, which weakened Mauritius’s fiscal and debt position. The **July 2022 downgrade to Baa3** came after it became clear that the fiscal deterioration was not temporary; Moody’s cited the **weaker institutional capacity** to handle shocks and concerns that debt reduction would be slower than hoped ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=MAKING%20WEAKENS%20MAURITIUS%27S%20CAPACITY%20TO,be%20slower%20than%20previously%20expected)) ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=This%20informs%20Moody%27s%20view%20that,measures%20can%20reduce%20financing%20needs)). At the same time, Moody’s changed the outlook to stable in 2022, recognizing that the worst of the pandemic was over and that political/social stability and a return to growth would likely prevent further near-term downgrades ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=RATIONALE%20FOR%20CHANGING%20THE%20OUTLOOK,Prior%20to%20the%20coronavirus)). The outlook downgrade to negative in 2025 indicates Moody’s view that **fiscal challenges remain pressing**, as Mauritius’s public debt is still high and needs credible measures to put it on a downward trend ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20important%20fiscal,one%20notch%20above%20country%20rating)). The Moody’s 2025 review highlighted the need for **urgent reforms to address fiscal imbalances**, even as it acknowledged the strength of the banking sector and the broader economy’s robustness ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20important%20fiscal,one%20notch%20above%20country%20rating)).

In summary, **Mauritius’s Moody’s ratings over the past 28 years reflect a story of resilience tempered by vulnerabilities**. The country’s consistent investment-grade status has been underpinned by its stable governance, relatively high income and diversified economy, and prudent management during normal times. These strengths enabled Mauritius to weather shocks and even achieve a rating upgrade when global conditions allowed. On the other hand, **periods of economic stress and rising debt – from the trade disruptions of the mid-2000s to the unprecedented pandemic fallout – have led Moody’s to adjust outlooks and eventually downgrade the rating** to ensure it aligns with the country’s weaker fiscal metrics. The key drivers influencing Moody’s assessments include **economic growth trends, the health of public finances, policy credibility, and exposure to external shocks**. Major improvements (such as successful economic reforms and stable growth) have been rewarded with positive rating actions, whereas major setbacks (such as a sudden surge in debt or a collapse in tourism revenues) have prompted caution or negative actions. Going forward, Mauritius’s ability to **restore fiscal sustainability and maintain growth** in a challenging global environment will be crucial to preserving its investment-grade rating. Moody’s recent commentary suggests that while the **medium-term economic prospects remain solid**, the **government’s policy response to debt and structural challenges** will be closely watched and will determine the trajectory of Mauritius’s sovereign credit rating ([Communiqué: Moody's report - Mauritius Bankers Association (MBA)](https://mba.mu/communique-moodys-report/#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20important%20fiscal,one%20notch%20above%20country%20rating)) ([](https://www.maurice-info.mu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rating-Action-Moodys-downgrades-Mauritiuss-rating-to-Baa3-changes-outlook-to-stable-28Jul22.pdf#:~:text=on%20a%20sustained%20downward%20path,declining%20as%20the%20government%20forecasts)).
