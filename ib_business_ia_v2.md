# Research Question
"To what extent have Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices impacted its financial performance and market share in South Africa from 2022 to 2024?"  

---

# 1. Introduction

Woolworths Food is a leading South African grocery retailer renowned for its **Good Business Journey (GBJ)** – a sustainability strategy launched in 2007 that embeds ethical sourcing into its operations [1].

*Ethical sourcing* refers to procuring products in a responsible manner, ensuring fair labour practices, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain. Woolworths has committed to an “ethical supply chain from floor to store, farm to fork,” aligning with its vision to be one of the world’s most responsible retailers [2].

For example, **85% of Woolworths’ own-brand food products** are produced under its *Farming for the Future* programme, which promotes sustainable farming practices among suppliers [3].

Additionally, **99.9% of its seafood by volume** meets sustainability standards [3], and all its private‐label cotton and timber are responsibly sourced [3].

These initiatives differentiate Woolworths Food in the market by offering consumers high‐quality products that are ethically and sustainably sourced [4].

# 2. Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is a tool that analyses the key stakeholders of a business and prioritises them based on their interests and power. High-power and high-interest stakeholders require close management, while low-interest and low-power stakeholders need minimal management.

This tool is important for managing stakeholder conflict that can occur when the expectations of different stakeholder groups become incompatible. Such conflicts often arise over resource allocation, differing ethical considerations, and strategic decisions.

Key stakeholders used in this analysis include:
- **Customers**
- **Employees**
- **Suppliers**
- **Local Community**

Below, each of these stakeholders is analysed in more detail.

## 2.1 Customers (Highest Level of Influence)

This stakeholder group has the highest level of influence on the business and should therefore be closely monitored. Customers are interested in high‐quality and ethically sourced products available at a reasonable price, especially as taxes and inflation rates increase over time.

Woolworths has implemented sustainable farming and fishing practices, which differentiate its products and services from those of its competitors [5].

Woolworths also caters to its customers by providing plant‐based products to address a wider target market.

In 2023, Customer Care scores ranked 80%, increasing to 84% in 2024, which demonstrates that Woolworths’ practices have led to growing consumer trust and brand loyalty [5].

## 2.2 Employees

Employees are concerned with safe working conditions, inclusivity, and career development opportunities. Woolworths addresses these needs by investing in skills development programmes that ensure its workforce is well-trained and motivated.

The company’s Graduate Development Programmes focus on developing employee strengths, thereby enhancing customer service and bolstering brand reputation. Notably, the workforce increased from 32,019 in 2023 to 32,675 in 2024, likely reflecting improved inclusion initiatives and greater investment in training [5].

## 2.3 Suppliers

Woolworths meets the needs of its suppliers by partnering with local farmers, ensuring that its products are ethically sourced and that sustainability practices are maintained.

Additionally, the company has invested in its Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) programme to promote inclusiveness within the South African supply chain. These initiatives have enhanced product quality and sustainability, supporting both brand recognition and healthier relationships between Woolworths and its suppliers [5].

## 2.4 Local Community

The local community is generally interested in health and safety, community upliftment through training, infrastructure development, and waste reduction. Woolworths addresses these concerns by implementing food distribution programmes, making donations, and partnering with non-governmental organisations such as FoodForward in South Africa.

Furthermore, Woolworths supports the community through its educational programme, MySchool, which raises funds for local schools [5].

## 2.5 Conclusion

The stakeholder mapping analysis demonstrates that Woolworths’ ethical sourcing strategies have positively influenced stakeholder relationships from 2022 to 2024. This is evident from rising Customer Care scores, increased workforce numbers, and stronger supplier and community ties.

Effective stakeholder management can lead to:
- Improved relationships among stakeholders  
- Enhanced corporate reputation  
- Increased collaboration  
- Long-term success through balanced decision-making  

However, stakeholder interests evolve over time, and data availability may vary. It is therefore essential for Woolworths to engage in ongoing market research and communication with stakeholders to address their changing needs.

# 3. Financial Analysis

This section assesses whether Woolworths’ ethical sourcing practices have impacted its profitability and overall financial performance.

## 3.1 Profitability Ratios

Examining total revenue and operating profit from 2022 to 2024 reveals that revenue declined from R82.26 billion in 2022 to R72.69 billion in 2023, before recovering in 2024 to R77.93 billion—although still below the 2022 level [6].

Operating profit declined from R6.77 billion in 2022 to R6.64 billion in 2023, and then further to R5.95 billion in 2024. This trend suggests that price pressures and rising costs have negatively affected profitability [6].

### Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin is calculated as:

```
Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100%
```

Between 2022 and 2024, Woolworths’ gross profit margin increased from 37.0% to 38.5% [7].

This margin is notably higher than those of competitors such as ShopRite (approximately 25%) and Pick n Pay (approximately 23%), suggesting that Woolworths’ premium pricing strategy and ethical practices confer a competitive advantage [7].

*To further improve its gross profit margin, Woolworths might consider increasing prices for inelastic products and offering unique products that justify higher mark-ups.*

### Net Profit Margin

Net profit margin, which measures revenue after deducting expenses, taxes, depreciation, and interest, increased from 6.0% to 6.5% between 2022 and 2024 [7].

In contrast, competitors such as ShopRite and Pick n Pay have net profit margins of approximately 3% and 2.5%, respectively [7].

Key factors affecting profitability include cost structure, pricing strategy, operational efficiency, and market conditions. Woolworths can improve profitability by growing revenue through sales and price optimisation, as well as reducing costs through increased efficiency. However, caution is required since price increases might deter some customers.

The limitation of profitability ratios is that they focus solely on financial data and do not capture nonfinancial factors.

## 3.2 Liquidity Ratios

### Current Ratio

The current ratio is calculated as:

```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

Woolworths’ current ratio decreased from 1.12 in 2022 to 1.02 in 2023, and further to 0.92 in 2024 [8].

Comparatively, ShopRite has a current ratio of approximately 1.2, while Pick n Pay’s is around 0.89 [8]. This indicates that Woolworths has higher capital requirements, possibly due to its premium inventory and ethical sourcing practices.

*To improve its current ratio, Woolworths could consider retaining more profits to boost cash reserves and accelerating the collection of receivables.*

### Acid Test Ratio

The acid test ratio, which measures the ability to cover short-term liabilities using liquid assets, is calculated as:

```
Acid Test Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

Woolworths’ acid test ratio increased from 0.9 in 2023 to 1.1 in 2024 [9].

Although this is an improvement, Woolworths still underperforms compared to competitors such as ShopRite, which has an acid test ratio of 1.2 [9].

*Improvements could include prioritising debt collection and implementing stricter credit checks to enhance liquidity.*

# 4. Market Share Analysis

Market share is calculated as:

```
Market Share (%) = (Woolworths Revenue / Total Market Revenue) × 100
```

Woolworths’ market position benefited from an expanded online presence—especially with the Woolies Dash app—which helped capture changing consumer behaviour post-pandemic [10].

Woolworths maintained a market share of approximately 12% in the national food and clothing sectors, which increased to 13.5% by 2024 [10]. This modest increase suggests that the company’s focus on sustainability—such as sourcing 100% cage-free eggs and reducing plastic packaging—has contributed to retaining and slightly growing its market share despite competitive pressures from retailers targeting lower-income customers.

# 5. Conclusion (Final)

In conclusion, the analysis using stakeholder mapping, financial ratios, and market share metrics demonstrates that Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices have positively impacted its financial performance and market share in South Africa from 2022 to 2024.

- **Stakeholder Perspective:** Ethical sourcing has enhanced customer trust (with Customer Care scores rising from 80% to 84%), increased workforce numbers, and strengthened supplier and community relations.
- **Financial Performance:** Despite revenue fluctuations, improvements in gross and net profit margins indicate that Woolworths’ premium pricing and sustainability strategy have sustained profitability.
- **Market Share:** The modest increase in market share—from approximately 12% to 13.5%—suggests that ethical sourcing has helped Woolworths maintain its competitive position, even amid external challenges.

While external factors such as economic pressures and competitive dynamics have also influenced these outcomes, ethical sourcing appears to be a key driver in sustaining customer loyalty, protecting margins, and supporting modest market share growth.
