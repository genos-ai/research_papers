## 1. Introduction

Woolworths Food is a leading South African grocery retailer renowned for its **Good Business Journey (GBJ)** – a sustainability strategy launched in 2007 that embeds ethical sourcing into its operations. *Ethical sourcing* refers to procuring products in a responsible manner, ensuring fair labour practices, animal welfare and environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain. Woolworths has committed to an “ethical supply chain from floor to store, farm to fork”, aligning with its vision to be one of the world’s most responsible retailers.

For example, **85% of Woolworths’ own-brand food products** are produced under its *Farming for the Future* programme, which promotes sustainable farming practices among suppliers. Additionally, **99.9% of its seafood by volume** meets sustainability standards, and all its private-label cotton and timber are responsibly sourced. These initiatives differentiate Woolworths Food in the market by offering consumers high-quality products that are ethically and sustainably sourced.

This report analyses the impact of Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices on its financial performance and market share in South Africa from 2022 to 2024. It is structured as a business report following IB Business Management standards, with an examination of key stakeholder impacts, financial ratio analysis and market share trends.

Key terms such as ethical sourcing and the financial ratios (profitability and liquidity metrics) are defined in context. All findings are supported by data from Woolworths’ **Good Business Journey Reports (2022, 2024)**, the **2022 Annual Financial Statements** and other relevant public sources. The analysis will show how Woolworths Food’s commitment to ethical sourcing has influenced stakeholder relationships and contributed to the company’s performance in a competitive retail environment.

## 2. Stakeholder Mapping

Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices affect a range of stakeholders. A stakeholder mapping is conducted for four key groups – **customers, employees, suppliers and the local community** – to assess how these practices influence each group’s relationship with the company.

### 2.1 Customers

Customers have a high level of influence on Woolworths Food’s success and are primarily interested in product quality, safety and alignment with their values. Woolworths addresses these needs by differentiating its products through sustainable farming and fishing practices.

For instance, Woolworths offers a range of **organically farmed and responsibly fished products**, and it has expanded its **plant-based product line** to cater to health-conscious and environmentally aware consumers. These ethical sourcing initiatives appeal to customers who value sustainability, thereby strengthening customer loyalty.

There is evidence that Woolworths Food’s focus on ethical sourcing and product quality has led to **growing consumer trust and satisfaction**. In 2023, Woolworths’ internal Customer Care index scored 80%, which **increased to 84% in 2024**, indicating improved customer satisfaction year-on-year. This improvement coincided with the company’s enhanced sustainability efforts and suggests that consumers respond positively to Woolworths’ ethical practices.

Woolworths has also been **recognised as a top sustainable brand** – it was listed among the top 10 most valuable brands in South Africa and awarded the “Most Admired Brand for doing good” in 2024. Such public accolades reflect a strong brand reputation built on ethical conduct. The trust earned from customers through ethical sourcing has tangible benefits: it encourages repeat purchases, justifies Woolworths’ premium pricing and helps defend its market position.

### 2.2 Employees

Employees are concerned with safe working conditions, job security, inclusivity and opportunities for growth. Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing philosophy extends to how it treats its workforce, emphasising fairness and development. The company has **invested heavily in employee training and development**, spending **R209 million on training programmes in 2024** across the group.

This includes skills development and **Graduate Development Programmes** aimed at building employee capabilities and engagement. By equipping staff with knowledge about sustainable practices and ethical standards, Woolworths not only ensures its values are upheld on the front lines but also motivates employees through a strong sense of purpose.

Woolworths’ commitment to inclusivity and ethical conduct has also made it an attractive and equitable workplace. The company was ranked among the top employers for gender equality in emerging markets (Equileap 2024). Between 2022 and 2024, Woolworths’ workforce grew from about 32,000 to **32,675 employees**, partly attributed to its efforts in empowering women and hiring people with disabilities. 

This growth suggests that Woolworths’ ethical brand and sustainable growth have enabled job creation and retention. Employees take pride in working for a company known for social responsibility, which improves morale. In turn, high employee satisfaction can reduce turnover and improve productivity. Overall, Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing ethos – coupled with its investments in employee well-being and development – has positively influenced staff motivation and loyalty, creating a workforce that supports the company’s long-term success.

### 2.3 Suppliers

Suppliers (including farmers, producers and other vendors) are critical stakeholders in Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing strategy. Their interests include fair pricing, long-term partnerships and support in meeting sustainability standards. Woolworths has actively **partnered with local farmers and producers**, helping them adopt sustainable practices.

Through its Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) programme, Woolworths invests in building capacity among small and medium suppliers. These initiatives include training on ethical sourcing requirements (e.g. proper labour conditions, environmental management) and providing resources to improve product quality. By doing so, Woolworths helps suppliers meet its rigorous standards (such as Farming for the Future or certified organic programmes), which in turn improves the consistency and sustainability of Woolworths’ supply chain.

Woolworths’ ethical sourcing programmes have strengthened supplier relationships. Suppliers benefit from guaranteed offtake agreements and skills transfer, while Woolworths gains reliable access to high-quality, ethically produced goods. For example, by 2024 **85% of Woolworths-branded foods were produced under sustainable farming methods**, as noted earlier, indicating extensive supplier participation in its ethical sourcing schemes.

Additionally, Woolworths ensures inclusivity in its supply chain – sourcing from **black-owned and small-scale farms** as part of its local procurement drive. The success of these collaborations is evident in improved product quality and innovation, which bolster Woolworths’ brand reputation. Suppliers, in turn, enjoy increased demand and stable partnerships. Thus, Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices have created a **mutually beneficial relationship** with suppliers: the company secures sustainable supply lines and unique products, while suppliers gain support and fair terms, contributing to their own community development and economic inclusion.

### 2.4 Local Community

The local community expects businesses like Woolworths to contribute positively to society – through job creation, community upliftment, environmental stewardship and charity. Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing and broader GBJ initiatives have significant community impact.

One major focus area is food security and waste reduction. Woolworths donates surplus food to help feed vulnerable communities, rather than letting it go to waste. In the **2024 financial year, Woolworths donated surplus food worth R816 million** to disadvantaged communities and charities. This contribution, done in partnership with FoodForward SA (a food redistribution NGO), equated to **56.6 million meals** provided to about 920,000 people across South Africa.

Woolworths also engages in community development and educational support. The company runs the well-known **MySchool MyVillage MyPlanet** programme, which raises funds for local schools and charities every time customers swipe their MySchool cards. Over the years, this programme has channelled substantial funding into education and conservation causes. Woolworths’ GBJ reports highlight additional projects like the *Living Soils Community Farm*, which trains young farmers in regenerative agriculture and supplies fresh produce to schools.

Moreover, Woolworths has committed resources to infrastructure and donations for disaster relief and healthcare in communities (e.g. through the Woolworths Trust). These community-focused initiatives align with Woolworths’ ethical sourcing philosophy by tackling social issues in its value chain (such as improving livelihoods of farm communities and reducing waste).

The impact on the local community has been largely positive between 2022 and 2024. Community stakeholders view Woolworths as a *responsible and caring company*, which enhances the company’s social licence to operate. Woolworths Holdings was ranked among the Top 20 companies in emerging markets for its gender equality and sustainability efforts in 2024, reflecting its broader contribution to society.

## 3. Financial Analysis

To evaluate Woolworths Food’s financial performance from 2022 to 2024, key **profitability** and **liquidity** ratios are analysed. Profitability ratios (Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin) indicate how well the company converts revenue into profit, which can reflect the financial viability of its ethical sourcing strategy (e.g. premium pricing versus higher costs).

Liquidity ratios (Current Ratio and Acid Test Ratio) assess the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations, highlighting the impact of its working capital management amidst sustainability investments and market conditions. All figures are drawn from Woolworths’ financial statements and reports for the South African operations or consolidated group.

### 3.1 Gross Profit Margin

**Gross Profit Margin (GPM)** is the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold. It reflects how efficiently a retailer manages procurement costs and pricing.

Between 2022 and 2024, Woolworths Food’s GPM **improved slightly despite inflationary pressures**, suggesting resilient profitability. In 2022, the Woolworths Food segment had a gross margin of **24.0%**, which rose to **24.4% in 2023** and further to **24.7% in 2024**. 

This upward trend indicates that Woolworths was able to maintain or improve its product mark-ups each year. One factor was the company’s ability to charge premium prices for its high-quality, ethically sourced products. Customers appear willing to pay a bit more for Woolworths’ offerings due to the perceived higher value and ethical assurances.

Additionally, internal efficiencies played a role – Woolworths cut waste and optimised its supply chain over this period, offsetting some cost increases. For example, in 2024 Woolworths Food’s margin increase was attributed to “more effective promotions, reduced waste and value chain efficiencies” which **more than offset** the higher costs incurred (such as expanding online delivery).

It is worth comparing Woolworths’ GPM to competitors to understand the competitive advantage. Woolworths Holdings (which includes Food and Fashion) enjoys a significantly higher overall GPM (around **37–38%** in recent years) than purely food-focused rivals like Shoprite (~25%) or Pick n Pay (~23%). Even focusing just on groceries, Woolworths Food’s ~24–25% gross margin in 2022–24 is on par or slightly above mainstream grocery chains. 

This suggests Woolworths’ strategy of sourcing ethically and focusing on premium segments has not eroded its margin – in fact, it helps justify premium pricing. However, Woolworths did engage in “price investment” (deliberately keeping some prices low to remain competitive) during this period, especially as consumer budgets tightened. This strategy, along with higher supply chain costs, caused a minor dip in GPM in 2022 (down 0.5 percentage points from 2021). By 2024, conditions improved and Woolworths recovered gross margin by tightening cost controls.

Overall, the stable-to-rising GPM from 2022 to 2024 indicates that Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices were compatible with strong profitability. The company managed to pass on costs or find efficiencies, thereby sustaining a healthy gross margin while staying true to its values.

### 3.2 Net Profit Margin

**Net Profit Margin (NPM)** measures the percentage of revenue that remains as net profit after all expenses (including operating costs, interest and taxes). It is a key indicator of overall profitability.

Woolworths’ net profit margin over 2022–2024 shows the company remained profitable, although there were some fluctuations due to external challenges. In the financial year 2022, Woolworths Holdings achieved a net profit (after tax) of about R3.4 billion on revenue of R82.3 billion (rough figures from annual reports), yielding a net margin in the range of **4–5%**.

This improved in 2023 as profits grew faster than sales – profit before tax jumped 29.5% to R6.7 billion in FY2023, partly boosted by the sale of the Australian David Jones unit. Turnover grew by 7% to R85.7 billion in 2023, so the **net margin likely rose to around 6%** that year (aided by one-off gains and operational improvements).

By 2024, the net margin may have normalised slightly lower, as the prior year’s one-off gains fell out and Woolworths invested more in growth and price competitiveness. The exact net margin for 2024 is around 5% (assuming ~R4.0 billion net profit on ~R78 billion revenue, continuing operations).

Despite these movements, Woolworths has consistently outperformed major competitors on net profitability. For context, Shoprite – the largest food retailer in South Africa – had a net profit margin of roughly **3%** in recent years, and Pick n Pay’s net margin was even thinner (around **2–2.5%** before it fell into a loss in 2023).

Woolworths’ higher net margins reflect its more upmarket product mix and operational efficiency. Ethical sourcing likely contributes to this by enhancing brand loyalty and allowing slightly higher pricing, but it also incurs costs (e.g. investing in supplier development and quality control). The data suggests Woolworths struck a reasonable balance – its **operating profit margin** in the Food business was about 7–8% during 2022–2024 (e.g. 7.3% in 2022), which indicates solid underlying profitability even after absorbing the costs of sustainable initiatives.

In summary, Woolworths Food managed to maintain a respectable net profit margin through 2022–2024. Ethical practices did not hinder profitability; in fact, by differentiating the brand, they may have supported revenue and helped protect profit margins in a challenging economy. The slight decline in 2024’s margin (versus 2023) can be attributed to broader economic headwinds and strategic price investments rather than the ethical sourcing programme itself. The company still delivered value to shareholders as evidenced by robust earnings per share and dividend payouts over the period.

### 3.3 Current Ratio

**Current Ratio** is a liquidity ratio that compares current assets to current liabilities, indicating a company’s ability to cover short-term obligations with short-term assets. A ratio above 1.0 is generally desirable for comfort.

Woolworths Holdings’ current ratio has been slightly below the conventional “2:1” benchmark, which is common in the retail sector (retailers often operate with low current ratios due to fast inventory turnover and use of cash). In 2022, Woolworths had a **current ratio of about 1.1** (current assets slightly exceeded current liabilities). By 2023 this ratio was **approximately 1.0**, and it edged down to **0.9 in 2024**.

This downward trend means that by 2024, current liabilities were a bit higher than current assets. Several factors could explain this decline in liquidity: Woolworths might have increased its short-term borrowings or payables (for example, to finance inventory or capital projects) while keeping less cash on hand, or it could be the effect of classifying certain assets/liabilities as held for sale during the David Jones divestiture.

Additionally, the company returned value to shareholders and invested in growth (e.g. store expansions, acquisitions), which can reduce liquid resources. Importantly, a current ratio below 1 does *not* necessarily indicate distress for Woolworths, as the business model generates steady cash from sales and can rely on inventory turnover and supplier credit.

Nonetheless, the slight weakening of the current ratio suggests a tighter working capital position by 2024. This could partially be an outcome of its sustainability efforts – for example, holding more **inventory** of local seasonal produce or higher-cost ethical goods might tie up capital. Management noted rising **supply chain costs** and some **stock build-up** in certain periods, which can affect short-term liquidity.

### 3.4 Acid Test Ratio

The **Acid Test Ratio** (or quick ratio) is a stricter liquidity measure that excludes inventory from current assets, focusing on the most liquid assets (cash, receivables). It indicates the ability to pay short-term liabilities without relying on selling inventory.

Woolworths Holdings’ acid test ratio has been below 1.0, reflecting that a lot of its current assets are tied up in inventory (which is typical for retail). In 2022, the acid test ratio was approximately **0.5:1** (meaning liquid assets covered about half of current liabilities). This figure declined over the next two years – by 2023 the quick ratio was around **0.45**, and it dropped to about **0.31 in 2024**.

The fall in the quick ratio from 0.5 to 0.3 over 2022–2024 indicates that Woolworths became more reliant on inventory (and less on cash or receivables) to bolster its current assets. Essentially, if one removes stock from the equation, the company had only 31 pence of truly liquid assets for every R1 of short-term debt in 2024.

This low acid test ratio is not unusual for a grocery retailer: much of Woolworths’ cash is continuously reinvested in inventory, and customers mostly pay cash or card (so receivables are minimal). Nonetheless, the declining trend bears watching. It could imply Woolworths held more inventory (possibly to ensure availability or due to supply chain timing) and/or had less cash on hand.

For instance, Woolworths significantly expanded its **online delivery (Woolies Dash)** and convenience offerings, which requires buffering stock in stores and distribution centres, potentially elevating inventory levels. The company also **invested in price** (absorbing some costs) which might have slowed cash accumulation.

Comparatively, Woolworths’ quick ratio is lower than that of some peers. Shoprite’s quick ratio was reported around **1.2** in recent analyses, indicating Shoprite holds relatively less inventory (proportionally) or more cash on its balance sheet. Woolworths’ more premium, diversified product mix might require higher inventory holdings, thus explaining part of this difference.

From a risk perspective, a 0.3 quick ratio means Woolworths would rely on selling inventory to meet a sudden short-term cash need. Given its strong sales momentum, this is manageable, but it underscores the importance of inventory management. Encouragingly, Woolworths has been proactive in this area – for example, it reduced food waste and improved ordering systems to ensure stock levels match demand.

Overall, while liquidity ratios indicate a slight deterioration between 2022 and 2024, Woolworths Food remained capable of meeting its short-term obligations. The company’s prudent working capital management, alongside its banking facilities, provided sufficient liquidity to support operations and its Good Business Journey investments.

## 4. Market Share Analysis

Market share measures a company’s proportion of total industry sales. For Woolworths Food, market share in South Africa’s grocery sector is a key indicator of competitive impact.

In 2022, Woolworths was estimated to hold roughly **12% of the South African retail market** (combining food and clothing segments). Its share is smaller in pure grocery terms – the big three rivals have greater store networks catering to all income segments. However, Woolworths targets mainly upper-middle and high-income consumers and urban markets with its premium food offering.

By 2024, Woolworths’ market share had increased to about **13.5%** of the national retail market. This indicates a notable gain in market position over two years. Internally, Woolworths reported “market-leading growth” in its Food division, translating to **market share gains against competitors**.

For example, in the second half of FY2024, Woolworths Food grew turnover by 8.5% (adjusted) which outpaced the broader market growth, resulting in increased share of the market. Similarly, in the first half of 2024, Woolworths Food’s sales rose by approximately 9%, even as some competitors struggled, leading to further market share gains.

Several factors linked to Woolworths’ strategy help explain these market share improvements. 

Firstly, the company’s **ethical sourcing and quality focus has fortified its brand loyalty** – even when consumers faced economic pressure, a core segment remained loyal to “Woolies” for its trusted quality (reinforced by ethical and sustainable attributes). This helped Woolworths retain customers while some competitors lost footfall due to product shortages or reputation issues.

Secondly, Woolworths capitalised on the growth of e-commerce. It launched the **Woolies Dash** on-demand delivery app and rapidly grew online grocery sales (+52.8% in FY2024). This omni-channel expansion made Woolworths more accessible, attracting new customers (including younger, tech-savvy consumers) without compromising its values. The GBJ commitment extends online too (e.g. using eco-friendly packaging for deliveries). In 2023–24, as consumer behaviour shifted post-pandemic, Woolworths’ online presence gave it a competitive edge, contributing to its **72% increase in online sales** at one point.

Another contributor to market share is the *trusted value proposition*. While Woolworths is premium, it did implement targeted promotions and kept key staple prices competitive, ensuring it wasn’t perceived as unaffordable. Woolworths’ CEO noted that ongoing investment in price and value, combined with its ethical positioning, strengthened customer trust. In effect, Woolworths aimed to deliver **“value with values”** – balancing fair prices with ethical sourcing. This strategy likely drew some cautious shoppers to stick with Woolworths rather than down-trading to other stores.

Additionally, Woolworths’ focus on sustainability resonated with a growing segment of consumers who prefer environmentally and socially responsible brands. For example, Woolworths’ move to sourcing **100% cage-free eggs** and reducing single-use plastics meets the demands of ethically minded consumers. These differentiators set Woolworths apart from competitors and can attract customers who might otherwise shop elsewhere.

By 2024, Woolworths Food’s market share gains demonstrate that ethical sourcing can go hand-in-hand with commercial success. The company held or slightly grew its share of the R807 billion South African food retail market even as rivals like Pick n Pay lost ground (with Pick n Pay experiencing significant declines and restructuring in 2023). According to industry reports, Shoprite remains the market leader, but Woolworths has solidified its position as the **leading premium food retailer** and one of the fastest-growing in terms of same-store sales. 

Woolworths’ market share of ~13.5% in 2024, up from ~12% in 2022, reflects successful strategy execution. It is important to note that this growth occurred during a period of economic strain (low GDP growth, high inflation in 2022/23), indicating that Woolworths likely pulled customers from competitors by leveraging its strengths.

## 5. Conclusion

**Findings:** The analysis from 2022 to 2024 indicates that Woolworths Food’s ethical sourcing practices have had a **positive impact on its financial performance and market share** in South Africa. The company’s deep commitment to responsible sourcing – as embodied in its Good Business Journey – has strengthened relationships with customers, employees, suppliers and communities.

Customer loyalty improved, as evidenced by rising satisfaction scores and Woolworths’ recognition as a top sustainable brand, which in turn supported robust sales growth. Employees benefited from Woolworths’ ethical culture and training investment, leading to a motivated workforce that upholds the brand’s values. Suppliers received support to meet ethical standards, fostering dependable partnerships and consistent quality in Woolworths’ products. The local community gained through Woolworths’ social initiatives (food donations, education funding), enhancing the company’s public goodwill. These stakeholder gains have reinforced Woolworths Food’s reputation and operational stability – key intangibles that feed into financial success.

Financially, Woolworths Food sustained strong profitability while adhering to ethical sourcing. Its gross profit margin rose gradually from 2022 to 2024, showing that the company managed costs and commanded premium prices without sacrificing volume. Net profit margins remained higher than those of main competitors, indicating that Woolworths could absorb the costs of ethical initiatives due to efficiencies and brand-driven pricing power. Liquidity remained sufficient, though current and quick ratios declined slightly, reflecting increased investment and a challenging economic climate. Notably, the company maintained prudent working capital management to finance its sustainability programmes without compromising solvency.

In terms of market share, Woolworths modestly grew its slice of the market (to an estimated 13.5%), even as some rivals lost ground. Ethical sourcing and sustainability likely contributed to this resilience – aligning with consumer preferences and differentiating Woolworths from competitors. 

**Recommendations:** Going forward, Woolworths Food should continue to leverage ethical sourcing as a strategic advantage. The following recommendations are proposed:

- **Maintain and Communicate Ethical Differentiation:** Woolworths should keep expanding its sustainable product lines and clearly market these attributes. For instance, building on achievements like 100% sustainably sourced seafood and cage-free eggs, the company can communicate the positive impact of these practices to consumers. Effective storytelling about ethical sourcing (through in-store signage, social media and annual reports) will further strengthen customer loyalty and potentially attract new market segments who prioritise ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors.

- **Optimise Costs through Sustainable Innovation:** To ensure financial performance remains strong, Woolworths can invest in supply chain innovations that both reduce costs and advance ethical standards. For example, working closely with suppliers on regenerative agriculture can improve crop yields and quality, eventually lowering the cost of goods while enhancing sustainability. Continued efforts to reduce waste (food waste reduction, energy efficiency in stores) will also cut operating costs and underscore Woolworths’ environmental commitment. This creates a virtuous cycle where ethical practices improve the bottom line, which then funds further sustainability initiatives.

- **Enhance Supplier Development:** Woolworths should deepen its Enterprise and Supplier Development programmes to broaden its base of ethical suppliers. By helping more local farmers achieve certifications (organic, Fair Trade, etc.) and by possibly offering longer-term contracts, Woolworths can secure its supply of ethically sourced ingredients. This not only mitigates supply chain risks but also bolsters Woolworths’ image as a partner to the local economy.

- **Monitor Pricing and Affordability:** While Woolworths is a premium retailer, the economic environment in South Africa is challenging. The company should continue its strategy of **“investing in price”** on key staples and find efficiencies to keep ethical products competitively priced. This will prevent customer attrition to lower-priced competitors and demonstrate that sustainability and affordability can coexist. By growing volumes, Woolworths can achieve economies of scale in ethical sourcing, which helps maintain healthy profit margins.

- **Strengthen Online and Omnichannel Presence:** Building on the success of Woolies Dash and online sales growth, Woolworths should integrate its ethical sourcing message into the digital experience. Features like transparent product sourcing information online, or filters for ethically sourced products on the app, could enhance the customer experience for the growing online shopper base. Given that omnichannel retail is the “next battleground” for market share, ensuring Woolworths’ sustainability values carry through every channel will help capture more of the market, especially among younger consumers who shop online and care about brand values.

In implementing these recommendations, Woolworths must remain vigilant about external factors. The period examined showed that macroeconomic conditions (e.g. inflation, consumer income pressure) and one-off events (such as supply chain disruptions or a pandemic) can influence financial outcomes regardless of ethical practices. Continuous risk management and adaptability are therefore key. Nonetheless, Woolworths Food’s performance from 2022–2024 demonstrates that doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive. The company’s ethical sourcing practices have become a core competitive strength – **driving customer loyalty, supporting robust financial metrics and enabling steady market share growth**. By reinforcing this synergy between ethics and profitability, Woolworths is well positioned for sustainable success in the future.
